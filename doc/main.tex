\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Strictly interface composition based asynchronous actor oriented design pattern for LabVIEW Applications.
jettl also has the newer banners for vis. Easy adoption for the new age of LV developers.
State pattern with decorators.
It is interface composition, so stick with the same rule set for naming methods

\section{LabVIEW Interfaces}
\label{sec:labview-interfaces}

The default implementation idea works so only as there is only one method implementation across all interfaces.

For example, \\
class implements interface 1 and interface 2 \\
interface 1: method \\
interface 2: method \\
This cannot exist unless the class overrides the method.
Otherwise, at runtime, LabVIEW does not know to execute interface 1: method or interface 2: method.
