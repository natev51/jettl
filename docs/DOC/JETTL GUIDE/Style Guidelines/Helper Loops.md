**NO Helper Loops!**

Private Actor virtual folder allows actors to live within another actors library.
Separating the concerns of actors should be a normality where there’s the controller and view.
Think for an actor system, a queue actor that needs an event helper loop. Rather, make this helper loop an event actor that is tightly coupled to the queue actor by having the event actor in the same library as the queue actor.
