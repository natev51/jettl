# Creating 
Event Actor
1. Has One Caller Queue Actor
2. Is a Nested Event Actor of Queue Actor
3. Is a Self Event Actor

Queue Actor
1. Has One Caller Queue Actor
2. Is a Nested Queue Actor of Queue Actor
3. Is a Self Queue Actor


A Queue Actor can create both Queue Actors and Event Actors.
Whereas an Event Actor cannot Create either, this is an important framework constraint.
**Return to this**

# private messages

Private messages that arenâ€™t exposed to external callers: Library access scope.
With this, put the Last Ack Mag in jettl Library and make access scope private on library?


# references

jettl Queue Actor: Obtains and releases its own references.
jettl Event Actor: Creates, Registers, Unregisters, and Destroys its own references.


# In general notes

Maybe, Queue Actor really just is Actor where the Event Actor is just a since Msg that is DD called Event Msg where the Event Msg internally is just an event strucure acting as the front panel!

Some kind of Event Msg, just like the Loop.vi that is executed as talked about above.














# State Pattern

Context class should be private, since only interfaces should be composed into a class.
Dependency Inversion Principle.

Since the context class is private to the library it is in (and the State Interface with its concrete state classes), public static dispatch methods can be used in the context class AND concrete state classes without worrying that they'll be used outside the library since the context class is private.



Dev Panel need to update connector pane for Button and Pop Up


AF composition messaging SO easy.
map out the easy way of executing the Msg.






jettl Queue Actor -> jettl Actor




in jettl Actor
Event Create
Event Teardown
Event Loop
Event Last Ack








create, generate, destroy methlds
Update String Indicator Msg (Msg To)

in event strucutre, wire out the DVR to the event structure from user events.. this is where you DD?
